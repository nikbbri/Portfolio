                <span>Welcome! Thanks for stopping by. I’m currently a freelance designer and a new graduate of the University of Minnesota’s bootcamp program for UX/UI. I’ve discovered a love for solving all types of design issues and get excited about new challenges. Collaboration is my favorite part about every project, even in the more challenging ones, I’ve found that there is always something you can do better and something more to contribute.<br/><br/>My background is a combo of Computer Science and Communications, an Individualized Studies degree from Metropolitan State University. After exploring different avenues in IT, having been a coding student to project managing, I’ve found my home in the UX/UI world and can’t wait to contribute my experiences and new skills towards upcoming projects.<br/><br/>As the world continues to change and so technology, I’m excited to keep exploring new ways to grab users attention, create solutions that make their time on your site, app, or store more than pain-free but enjoyable. </span>
